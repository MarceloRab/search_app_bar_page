* Now you can assemble a Widget from RxString, RxInt, RxDouble, RxNumber and RxList. With the
  ```[getStreamWidget]``` extension. It turns your Rx variable into a ```[GetStreamWidget]```. If
  there is nothing in the stream, it starts the wait. When you add something, it launches
  obxBuilder. If there is an error, it starts the ErrorWidget. Ready to use.

* Learned the creative way to add bool parameter of auth to your page. configures ```[rxBoolAuth]```
  .
* To add other Rx parameters, just configure them within the ```[obxListBuilder]``` function in
  SearchAppBarPage and SearchAppBarPageStream. See complete example for details. So your page will
  be complete.
* Before it was ```[listBuilder]``` now ```[obxListBuilder]``` because this function can receive Rx
  variables for reactivity.
