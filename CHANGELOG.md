  your list. If you don't want to use a String from your Object, pass it directly to a function

  ex.: whereFilter: (Person person, Sring? query) => bool return - used to
  filter dates by the largest String,

## [2.1.1]

- Fix to change sortFunction to reset SearchAppBarPage after setState.

## [2.1.0]

- By request. Added option to add filtering function manually.
  Removes the need to return a String. May generate exception if the user
  types a letter and the dev wants to filter by the number. In this case,
  you need to handle the exception within the manual filtering function.
  New parameter for = > SearchAppBarPageStream and = > SearchAppBarPage is `[filter]`.
- Now the dev can add its own sorting function `[sortFunction]`.
  By default sorting is done from the return of `[stringFilter]`.

  `[getStreamWidget]` extension. It turns your Rx variable into a `[GetStreamWidget]`. If
  there is nothing in the stream, it starts the wait. When you add something, it launches
  obxBuilder. If there is an error, it starts the ErrorWidget. Ready to use.

  \_subscription?.cancel() stops generating warning.

  SearchAppBarPage and SearchAppBarPageStream. See complete example for details. So your page will
  be complete.
- Before it was `[listBuilder]` now `[obxListBuilder]` because this function can receive Rx
  variables for reactivity.
